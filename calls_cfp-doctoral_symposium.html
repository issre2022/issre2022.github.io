            <h1 class="page-header">Call for Papers - Doctoral Symposium 2022</h1>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Doctoral Symposium will take place on October 31 2022, virtually (online only), the day before the beginning of the main conference IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2022).</p>

            <h3><strong>Goal</strong></h3>

            <p>The ISSRE 2022 Doctoral Symposium is intended to bring together PhD students working on innovative research for monitoring, assessing, and improving the reliability, dependability, and security of software systems, and give them the opportunity
                to present and discuss their research in a constructive, friendly, and international atmosphere. The goals of the symposium are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>provide a setting for constructive feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions;</li>
                <li>develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research;</li>
                <li>provide an opportunity for student participants to interact with established researchers and practitioners in the software reliability engineering community.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Selected students will present their work and receive feedback both from a panel of experts from academia and industry, and from other Doctoral Symposium students. The students will also have the opportunity to seek advice on various aspects
                of completing a PhD, such as how to perform research, how to design and execute empirical research, etc.</p>

            <p>The papers accepted and presented at the Doctoral Symposium will be published in the supplementary conference proceedings of ISSRE 2022.</p>

            <h3><strong>Who should participate</strong></h3>

            <p>Students at all stages (at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end of their PhD) who are working on a thesis topic relevant to ISSRE are encouraged to participate in the Doctoral Symposium.</p>



            <h3><strong>Submissions</strong></h3>
            <p>Each submission consists of two elements:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>A 4-page paper describing your dissertation research to be authored by the student only, your advisor should be included in the acknowledgments.</li>
                <li>Please ask your advisor to submit a letter of recommendation in support of your application. This letter should include your name, a candid assessment of the current status of your dissertation research, list of publications on your topic
                    so far (if any), and an expected date for dissertation submission. The letter should be emailed to both Doctoral Symposium Co-Chairs (<a target="_blank" href="mailto:zhengz@buaa.edu.cn,hadi.hemmati@ucalgary.ca?subject=ISSRE 2022 Doctoral Symposium Recommendation">zhengz@buaa.edu.cn and hadi.hemmati@ucalgary.ca</a>)
                    with the subject “ISSRE 2022 Doctoral Symposium Recommendation”.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Your research proposal should contain the following items: 1) a title for your work; 2) an abstract (maximum 200 words); 3) a main description of your research work that covers: a) the technical problem to be solved, a justification of its
                importance regarding to software reliability, and a set of research questions; b) related works; 4) the proposed approach, including a) the research methodology to achieve the research goals; b) a brief description of the work accomplished
                to date c) your timeline and milestones; c) possible threats to validity; 5) finally, the expected contributions of your dissertation research along with the tentative date of your thesis defense.</p>

            <p>PhD students at an early stage should focus more on the technical problem to be solved, on the related works and on the motivations, than on the research approach, which should anyway be discussed in the paper. PhD students at a medium and
                advanced stage of their PhD should cover both the technical problem and the proposed approach. PhD students at an advanced stage may want to additionally discuss the impact of the contributions of their PhD work and the open challenges.</p>

            <p>All submissions must be original work, and must not have been previously published, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere.</p>

            <h3><strong>Formatting guidelines</strong></h3>

            <p>Papers must be written in English, and be formatted according to the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines</a>.</p>


            <h3><strong>Process</strong></h3>
