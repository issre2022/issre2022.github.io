            <h3><strong>Objective</strong></h3>
            <p class="rtejustify">ISSRE strives to be the conference that appeals to both researchers and practitioners. To that end, we invite proposals for workshops to co-locate with the Symposium and provide additional opportunities for collaborating and exchanging information.
                The workshops aim at discussing research developments and challenges at an early stage. ISSRE welcomes workshops that explore new ways to provide and assess software reliability, safety, and security. We also seek workshops that deal with
                the provision of reliable, safe, and secure software and systems in fast-growing, transformative application domains. Appropriately defined workshop proposals have the following characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They offer researchers a forum to exchange and discuss scientific and engineering ideas at an early stage before maturation that would warrant conference or journal publication;</li>
                <li>They attract practitioners and researchers to working sessions to discuss and make progress toward solutions to current and future problems in engineering high assurance software and systems;</li>
                <li>They focus on collaborative discussions and information sharing between researchers and industry practitioners.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3><strong>Recurring Workshops</strong></h3>
            <p class="rtejustify">Workshops affiliated with ISSRE in previous years are pre-approved. Their organizers do not need to submit a new workshop proposal. Their organizers are kindly asked to inform the workshop chairs about returning the workshop to ISSRE in 2022.</p>


            <h3><strong>Topics of Interest</strong></h3>
            <p>Topics of interest include development, analysis methods and models throughout the software development lifecycle, and are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary dependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability) impacting software reliability</li>
                <li>Secondary dependability attributes (i.e., survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability</li>
                <li>Reliability threats, i.e. faults (defects, bugs, etc.), errors, failures</li>
                <li>Reliability means (fault prevention, fault removal, fault tolerance, fault forecasting)</li>
                <li>Metrics, measurements and threat estimation for reliability prediction and the interplay with safety/security</li>
                <li>Reliability of software services</li>
                <li>Reliability of open source software</li>
                <li>Reliability of Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
                <li>Reliability of software dealing with Big Data</li>
                <li>Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software</li>
                <li>Reliability of software for systems based on artificial intelligence</li>
                <li>Reliability of software within specific types of systems (e.g., autonomous and adaptive, green and sustainable, mobile systems)</li>
                <li>Reliability of software within specific technological spaces (e.g., Internet of Things, Cloud, Semantic Web/Web 3.0, Virtualization, Blockchain)</li>
                <li>Normative/regulatory/ethical spaces pertaining to software reliability</li>
                <li>Societal aspects of software reliability</li>
            </ul>


            <h3><strong>Proposal Format</strong></h3>
            <p>Workshop proposals should include information about the proposed organizing committee and address the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Workshop length: Half day or one full day</li>
                <li>Workshop style: papers, panels, posters, workgroups</li>
                <li>Outline of themes and goals of the workshop</li>
                <li>How will you solicit participation (call for workshop papers, invitation only, etc.)</li>
                <li>Desired/estimated number of participants</li>
                <li>Organizing committee members and their past experience</li>
            </ul>


            <h3><strong>Proposal Evaluation</strong></h3>
            <p class="rtejustify">Workshop proposals will be evaluated by the ISSRE 2022 Organizing Committee. The criteria include the alignment with the ISSRE charter, relevance to the larger ISSRE community, and the strength and experience of the organizing team.</p>
