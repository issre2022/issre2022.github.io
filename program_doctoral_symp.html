                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span>&nbsp;<span class="fst-italic">In the Star Wars Universe, a new trainee or a Padawan needs to undergo rigorous training, and go through various trials in order to obtain the rank of a Jedi Knight, or one who is a member of the Jedi order. In this talk, I'll point out the similarities between the training of a Jedi knight and that of a PhD student. Specifically, I'll discuss the nine trials/stages of a PhD student that mirror the trials in the training of Jedis:  teamwork, isolation, fear, anger, betrayal,  focus, instinct, forgiveness, and protection. I'll then share some tips and lessons on how to pass  these trials successfully, and become a true Jedi warrior ... I mean, graduate with a PhD. Along the way, I'll narrate some stories and share my own experiences (both positive and negative).</span></p>
