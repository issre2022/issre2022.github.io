                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span>&nbsp;<span class="fst-italic">Much of SE treats AI as some kind of off-the-shelf service where SE researchers and practitioners use tools, without modification, imported from the AI community. That approach is pragmatically appealing since, that way, SE people do not need a deep understanding of those   AI tools. Nevertheless, I would encourage you **not** to do that since SE needs a different kind of AI. Certainly, these new AI tools can be based on standard AI methods. But before we race to apply methods from other communities, we need to first reflect on what our community needs and knows and wants.   And if we do that, then we arrive at a better kind of AI for SE. To back up this argument, I will discuss applications from NASA flight control software, software text mining and sentiment analysis, software process planning, information retrieval, software quality prediction, software issue mitigation, software configuration,  search-based software engineering, hyperparameter optimization, software bias mitigation. </span></p>

                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Bio:</span>&nbsp;Tim Menzies (IEEE Fellow, Ph.D., UNSW, 1995) is a full Professor in CS at North Carolina State University where he teaches software engineering, automated software engineering, and foundations
                        of software science. He is the directory of the RAISE lab (real world AI for SE). that explores SE, data mining, AI, search-based SE, and open access science.</p>

                    <p class="rtejustify">He is the author of over 280 referred publications and editor of three recent books summarized the state of the art in software analytics. In his career, he has been a lead researcher on projects for NSF, NIJ, DoD, NASA, USDA (funding
                        totalling over 12 million dollars) as well as joint research work with private companies. For 2002 to 2004, he was the software engineering research chair at NASA's software Independent Verification and Validation Facility.</p>

                    <p class="rtejustify">Prof. Menzies is the co-founder of the PROMISE conference series devoted to reproducible experiments in software engineering (<a href="http://tiny.cc/seacraft" target="_blank">http://tiny.cc/seacraft</a>). He is an associate editor
                        of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, Communications of the ACM, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering Methodologies, Empirical Software Engineering, the Automated Software Engineering Journal the Big Data Journal, Information
                        Software Technology, IEEE Software, and the Software Quality Journal. In 2015, he served as co-chair for the ICSE'15 NIER track. He has served as co-general chair of ICSME'16 and co-PC-chair of SSBSE'17, and ASE'12.
