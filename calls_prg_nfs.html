            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="rtejustify">The ISSRE New Faculty Symposium has a goal to help new and prospective faculty members working in software reliability towards their (early) careers. This is challenging as new faculty members need to address myriad new challenges, typically
                beyond what they have been trained for in their doctoral studies, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="rtejustify">Career management and promotion</li>
                <li class="rtejustify">Networking</li>
                <li class="rtejustify">Publication strategies</li>
                <li class="rtejustify">Research funding</li>
                <li class="rtejustify">Mentoring students</li>
                <li class="rtejustify">Balancing teaching, service, and research</li>
                <li class="rtejustify">Work-life balance and personal satisfaction</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="rtejustify">The New Faculty Symposium event will follow a similar formula of past symposia in the field of software engineering (at ISSRE, ICSE and other venues). The program will feature invited talks by senior members of the research community, and
                opportunities for open discussion on a broad range of aspects of faculty life. The event will also give special emphasis on the differences between countries and academic cultures, as they may present special challenges due to different
                evaluation criteria, fund granting schemes, teaching environments, etc.
                <span class="fw-bold">We especially welcome participation from early career and prospective faculty members, though the event is open to everyone.</span></p>
